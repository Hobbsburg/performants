         "this app, formants are a naturally-occurring property of any tube (such as the " +
         "human vocal tract), that allow certain ranges of overtone frequencies to be reinforced.")
st.write("For example, if a column of air is excited at a frequency of 120 Hz, and the column has formants in the ranges of " +
         "250-350 Hz and 2200-3000 Hz, the overtones at 240 Hz and 2280 will be reinforced, and our ear will process this " +
         "composite sound as the vowel [ i ]. Classical vocal pedagogy is concerned with the first five formants, but formants " +
         "3, 4 and 5 cluster together to form the 'Singer's Formant,' while formants 1 and 2 are generally sufficient for distinguishing " +
         "one vowel from another.")
st.write("This app is designed both to explore your natural formants in your native language, and also to use formant values to help " +
         "you produce French vowels more correctly. Jump to page 1 to test your natural formant values, and then to page 2 to try some " +
         "French vowels.")
